# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Tourism Safety Emergency Tracker is a mobile application/web platform designed to enhance traveler safety by monitoring location data, detecting potential emergencies, and facilitating rapid response through automated alerts and emergency contact systems. The application will track planned travel locations, detect deviations from expected routes, and provide emergency response capabilities including location sharing with travel companions and automatic emergency service notifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want to specify my planned travel locations and itinerary, so that the system can monitor my safety throughout my trip.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new trip THEN the system SHALL allow them to add multiple planned locations with dates and times
2. WHEN a user adds a location THEN the system SHALL validate the location exists and store GPS coordinates
3. WHEN a user specifies accommodation details THEN the system SHALL automatically include nearby relevant places (hotels, landmarks) in the monitoring zone
4. IF a user provides an itinerary THEN the system SHALL calculate expected travel pathways between locations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want the app to continuously monitor my location, so that it can detect if I deviate significantly from my planned route or locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location services are enabled THEN the system SHALL collect GPS coordinates every 5 minutes during active travel periods
2. WHEN the user's location is more than 2km from planned locations or pathways THEN the system SHALL trigger a deviation alert
3. IF the user has been stationary for more than 4 hours outside planned locations THEN the system SHALL trigger a safety check
4. WHEN monitoring location THEN the system SHALL respect user privacy settings and data retention policies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want to receive alerts when the system detects potential safety concerns, so that I can confirm my safety status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deviation is detected THEN the system SHALL send an immediate push notification asking "Are you safe?"
2. WHEN an alert is sent THEN the user SHALL have 15 minutes to respond before escalation
3. IF the user responds "Yes, I'm safe" THEN the system SHALL log the response and continue monitoring
4. WHEN an alert is dismissed THEN the system SHALL ask for optional context (e.g., "exploring nearby area")

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want the system to automatically contact emergency services if I don't respond to safety alerts, so that help can be dispatched if I'm in danger.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user doesn't respond to a safety alert within 15 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically contact local emergency services
2. WHEN contacting emergency services THEN the system SHALL provide the user's current GPS coordinates, planned itinerary, and emergency contact information
3. IF emergency services are contacted THEN the system SHALL simultaneously notify all designated emergency contacts
4. WHEN emergency protocols are activated THEN the system SHALL continue location tracking at 1-minute intervals

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want to share my location with travel companions and family members, so that they can monitor my safety and whereabouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up a trip THEN the user SHALL be able to add travel companions and emergency contacts
2. WHEN location sharing is enabled THEN designated contacts SHALL receive real-time location updates
3. IF a safety alert is triggered THEN all shared contacts SHALL be notified immediately
4. WHEN sharing location THEN users SHALL be able to set different permission levels (view-only, receive alerts, emergency contact)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a travel companion, I want to view shared locations and receive safety alerts, so that I can assist if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invited to share location THEN the companion SHALL receive a secure link to view the traveler's status
2. WHEN viewing shared location THEN the companion SHALL see current location, planned itinerary, and last check-in time
3. IF a safety alert is active THEN the companion SHALL receive immediate notifications with options to help
4. WHEN emergency services are contacted THEN companions SHALL be notified with full details and contact information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work reliably across different platforms and network conditions, so that safety monitoring continues even in remote areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL cache location data and sync when connection is restored
2. WHEN the app is available as both web and mobile THEN all core safety features SHALL work on both platforms
3. IF the device battery is low THEN the system SHALL optimize location tracking to preserve battery while maintaining safety monitoring
4. WHEN in offline mode THEN the system SHALL store critical data locally and attempt emergency SMS if cellular service is available

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer/maintainer, I want the codebase to be well-structured and documented, so that the project can be collaboratively developed on GitHub.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow Python best practices with clear documentation and type hints
2. WHEN features are implemented THEN they SHALL include comprehensive unit tests with >80% coverage
3. IF the project uses external APIs THEN all integrations SHALL be properly abstracted and documented
4. WHEN code is committed THEN it SHALL include clear commit messages and follow established branching strategies
