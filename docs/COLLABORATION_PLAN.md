# Tourism Safety Tracker - Collaborative Development Plan

## Team Division Strategy

Based on the implementation plan, here's how you can divide the work between two developers for parallel development:

## Developer A - Backend Core & Safety Systems
**Focus: Core backend infrastructure, safety algorithms, and emergency systems**

### Phase 1 - Foundation (Tasks 1-4)
- **Task 1**: Set up project structure and development environment ✅ (Already completed)
- **Task 2**: Implement core data models and database schema
- **Task 3**: Build authentication and user management system
- **Task 4**: Create trip management functionality

### Phase 2 - Safety Core (Tasks 5-6)
- **Task 5.2**: Implement geofencing and deviation detection algorithms
- **Task 6.1**: Create alert triggering and management
- **Task 6.2**: Implement emergency escalation system

### Phase 3 - Infrastructure (Tasks 13-14)
- **Task 13**: Implement security features and data protection
- **Task 14**: Set up deployment and monitoring infrastructure

## Developer B - Frontend & Communication Systems
**Focus: User interface, real-time features, and notification systems**

### Phase 1 - Communication Systems (Tasks 7-8)
- **Task 5.1**: Create location update API and data processing
- **Task 7.1**: Implement multi-channel notification service
- **Task 7.2**: Integrate external notification services
- **Task 8**: Create real-time location sharing system

### Phase 2 - Frontend Development (Task 9)
- **Task 9.1**: Create core web application structure
- **Task 9.2**: Implement interactive mapping and location features
- **Task 9.3**: Build alert and emergency interface

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features (Tasks 10-11)
- **Task 10**: Implement offline functionality and data synchronization
- **Task 11**: Add background location monitoring and optimization

## Shared Responsibilities
**Both developers collaborate on these tasks:**

- **Task 12**: Create comprehensive API documentation and testing
- **Task 15**: Conduct end-to-end testing and quality assurance

## GitHub Workflow Recommendations

```

### Branch Strategy
1. **Main branches:**
   - `main` - Production ready code
   - `develop` - Integration branch

2. **Feature branches:**
   - `feature/backend-models` (Developer A)
   - `feature/auth-system` (Developer A)
   - `feature/frontend-core` (Developer B)
   - `feature/notifications` (Developer B)
   - etc.

3. **Integration points:**
   - Weekly merges to `develop`
   - Coordinate API contracts before implementation
   - Regular sync meetings for interface definitions

### Coordination Points

#### Week 1-2: Foundation
- **Developer A**: Tasks 2-4 (Models, Auth, Trip Management)
- **Developer B**: Task 5.1 + 7.1 (Location API + Notification Service)
- **Sync**: API contract definitions for location updates and user management

#### Week 3-4: Core Features
- **Developer A**: Tasks 5.2, 6.1 (Geofencing, Alert Management)
- **Developer B**: Tasks 7.2, 8 (External Services, Real-time Sharing)
- **Sync**: Alert system interfaces and real-time communication protocols

#### Week 5-6: User Interface
- **Developer A**: Task 6.2 (Emergency Escalation)
- **Developer B**: Tasks 9.1-9.3 (Complete Frontend)
- **Sync**: Frontend-backend integration testing

#### Week 7-8: Advanced Features
- **Developer A**: Task 13 (Security Features)
- **Developer B**: Tasks 10-11 (Offline, Background Processing)
- **Sync**: Security review and performance optimization

#### Week 9-10: Finalization
- **Both**: Tasks 12, 14, 15 (Documentation, Deployment, Testing)

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standups (Async)
- What did you complete yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- Any blockers or dependencies?

### API Contract Management
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger specs for API definitions
- Commit API contracts before implementation
- Mock endpoints for parallel development

### Code Review Process
- All PRs require review from the other developer
- Focus on interface compatibility and code quality
- Use GitHub's review features for async collaboration

### Testing Strategy
- Each developer writes unit tests for their components
- Integration tests are written collaboratively
- End-to-end tests cover complete user workflows

## Dependency Management

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Models → API endpoints** (A creates, B consumes)
2. **Authentication → All protected endpoints** (A creates, B integrates)
3. **Location API → Frontend maps** (B creates both ends)
4. **Alert system → Frontend notifications** (A creates backend, B creates frontend)

### Parallel Development Tips
1. Use mock data/services during development
2. Define interfaces early and stick to them
3. Regular integration testing on `develop` branch
4. Document API changes immediately
5. Use feature flags for incomplete features

This division allows both developers to work independently while maintaining clear integration points and shared responsibilities for the most complex features.
