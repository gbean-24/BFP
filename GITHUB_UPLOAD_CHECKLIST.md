```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: `tourism-safety-tracker`
4. Description: "A comprehensive safety monitoring application for travelers"
5. Make it Public (for team collaboration)

### Team Onboarding
Share these links with your team:
- Repository: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tourism-safety-tracker`
- Contributing Guide: `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- AI Development Guide: `docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`
- Project Tasks: `.kiro/specs/tourism-safety-tracker/tasks.md`

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Instructions for Team

When team members use AI assistants (Kiro, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), they should:

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tourism-safety-tracker.git
cd tourism-safety-tracker
```

2. **Provide AI with project context**:
```
I'm working on the Tourism Safety Tracker project. Here's the context:

- Repository: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tourism-safety-tracker
- Requirements: .kiro/specs/tourism-safety-tracker/requirements.md
- Design: .kiro/specs/tourism-safety-tracker/design.md
- Tasks: .kiro/specs/tourism-safety-tracker/tasks.md
- Contributing Guide: docs/CONTRIBUTING.md
- AI Guide: docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md

I'm working on [specific task] and need help with [specific request].
```

3. **Follow the development workflow**:
   - Choose a task from tasks.md
